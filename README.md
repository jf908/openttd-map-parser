# OpenTTD Map Parser (and Writer)

This library is a ðŸ”¥blazingðŸ”¥ fast WIP map parser and writer for OpenTTD written in RustðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ with âœ¨[binrw](https://binrw.rs/)âœ¨.
The outer structure can be fully parsed/written but you will have to know the structure details to do more interesting things.

Right now you can use the town renamer CLI to import/export a list of town names specifically for JGR savefiles.

### Save to towns.json

```sh
cargo run --release --example town-renamer read ./game.sav
```

### towns.json to Save

```sh
cargo run --release --example town-renamer write ./game.sav ./towns.json -o new_save.sav
```
